# rmsssim

The goal of `rmsssim` is to provide an R interface for the MS-SSIM image
comparison metric. This was not written by me, `gzt`, this was imported
from [spatialcompare](https://github.com/colinr23/spatialcompare), which
has a number of other functions I am not interested in and some
dependencies that no longer work for me. This package only depends on
[raster](https://cran.r-project.org/package=raster).

## Installation

You can install this from github with:

``` r
#install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('gzt/rmsssim')
```
