Description: Computes MS-SSIM and SSIM, image quality metrics.
    This is from the spatialcompare package available at
    https://github.com/colinr23/spatialcompare. I, gzthompson, have added
    little to this, I've only pulled these functions out of an
    already-existing package and made minor changes.
