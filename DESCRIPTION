Description: Computes MS-SSIM and SSIM, image quality metrics.
    This is from the spatialcompare package available at
    https://github.com/colinr23/spatialcompare. I, gzthompson,
    have added little to this, I've only pulled these functions 
    out of an already-existing package and made minor changes.
